# PokeRand
This Google Chrome extension will fetch a randomly selected Pokemon from the PokeApi and display its name, image, id and types.

Features:
- After the PokeRand icon is clicked and the first randomly selected Pokemon has been fetched, users can click the open popup to fetch a new Pokemon.
- After a Pokemon is fetched for the first time, its data will be locally saved so it won't have to be fetched again through the PokeApi.
- When a Pokemon that has already been saved locally is selected by the extension, a pokeball will appear at the top right corner of the screen indicating that this Pokemon has already been saved.
